# Fast π

Fast π calculation, taken from
[this Futility Closet post](http://www.futilitycloset.com/2015/10/04/easy-pi/).
Calculates π to 100,000 digits and compares it to a reference value. Each iteration
takes about one second and there are 16 iterations. Change the value of PRECISION
in the code to 50 to see the accuracy increase with each iteration.
